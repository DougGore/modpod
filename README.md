MODpod - (c)2013 Douglas Gore <modpod@ssonic.co.uk>

MODpod is a WebAudio based Amiga / PC module player, currently there is support for MOD and S3M.

This is an early proof of concept implementation and still has much work to do to be a robust and accurate player. It's not the best JavaScript MOD player out there but might be the only Open Source one. As a bonus it also has some provisional support for ScreamTracker 3 (S3M).
